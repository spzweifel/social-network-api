# social-network-api

## Description

In this project, I was tasked with making a social media API. The functionality of this application is so that a user can be shown, added, updated, and deleted. The same is true for thoughts. Friends of these users can also be added and deleted. The future goal of this project is for reactions to thoughts to also be added and deleted. This functionality is forthcoming.
